# Sharp386
Sharp386 is a simplified version of the Intel 80386 processor instruction set written in C#.  Sharp386 is a work in progress and as of 
the time of writing, only a few instructions are supported. Current plans include implementing mostly used opcodes like MOV, ADD, SUB, INC,
DEC, MUL, DIV, CALL, RET, PUSH, POP, OR, AND, NOT, XOR as well as support for 16-bit and 32-bit mode.
